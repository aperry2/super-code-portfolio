<h1>Welcome to Alan Perry's<br> Gandalf Fanpage</h1>
<h3>Who is Gandalf?</h3>
<p>Gandalf is a character in the fantasy book trilogy <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, and the prequel <em>the Hobbit</em>, written by J.R.R. Tolkein. He is a very stylish wizard with a very long beard. You can find more information about Gandalf <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf">here</a>. Below are some images of Gandalf to show how his appearance has changed and stayed the same in movies about J.R.R. Tolkein's books.</p>
<h4>The Hobbit (1977)</h4>

<p>In this trippy 1977 animation, Gandalf's hat is brimless, but he has a very luxuious, braided-looking beard. His eyebrows are a giant unibrow that looks like it's part of his beard. This is probably the most comical-looking version of Gandalf.</p>

<h4>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003)</h4>

<p>When Peter Jackson remade the movies in 2001, he cast Ian McKellen as Gandalf. He became the canonical Gandalf and it's hard to see another actor playing this role now. In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, he becomes Gandalf the White after being Gandalf the Grey for most of the story.</p>

<h4>The Hobbit Trilogy (2012-2014)</h4>

<p>In the Hobbit trilogy, Sir Ian McKellen reprised his role as Gandalf even though he was 10 years older than when they made the first trilogy. He had to perform alone in a greenscreen room because they did not want to use practical effects.</p>
